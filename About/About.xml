Just because you're stuck on a Rimworld doesn't mean you can't celebrate the best holiday-Halloween! 
	
This mod adds a witches costume, a mummy costume, a vampires costume, a wolfman mask, a broom weapon, a cauldron fermenter, bats and black cats, skeletons, several candy treats and jack o'lanterns and a coffin just in time for the spookiest night of the year!
